Broad programs for Python 3

This code represents some simple python programs I got ideas for.

1) Codebase.py:
  This is the hub from which all the other programs can be run.

3) simplePhonebook:
  This is an interface which allows you to save and review phone contacts.
  Available information to save includes name, number, and notes to write about someone.
